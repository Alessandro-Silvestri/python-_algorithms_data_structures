Time complexity: number of computations in worst scenario
Space complexity: memory deployed

Ω omega - best scenario (iteration through a list and stop at the first item)
Θ theta - average scenario (iteration through a list and stop in the middle)
Ο omicron - worst scenario the most important (iteration through a list and stop at the last item)
